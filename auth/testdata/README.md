# Authentication Fixtures

The tokens.json file contains expired access and refresh tokens that were generated by the Ensign authtest package using random keys and fake data.

To regenerate the test fixture, uncomment the `Skip` in `authtest_test.go`, run the failing test and copy and paste the tokens into the JSON file.
